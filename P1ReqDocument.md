A simple quote database app

The point of this app is to utilize MongoDB to store strings and use CRUD techniques in the server.js file. 

1. Allow the user to enter any quote or saying along with a name. 
    -This will get CREATED and stored in an array and stored in the database.

2. The app will then display it on the landing page for users to see. 
    -There will be some preloaded quotes in the database that will be visible to the user.
    -The app will READ these off the database.
    -Sayings can only be added by the user, not deleted.   

3. The app will have a button to UPDATE the list by adding a default quote. 
    -This will UPDATE the list and CREATE a predefined quote. 
    -This will inturn be READ and displayed to the user. 

4. There will be another button to DELETE the default quote. 
    -This will UPDATE the database and DELETE the object from the array.
